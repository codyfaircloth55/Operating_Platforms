# Software-Design-Template
#The Gaming Room was an online game developer wanting to create software to host their new game Draw it or Lose it accross multiple operating systems, including mobile operating systems
#The software was basically a database of user, team, and game information along with a library of photos for gameplay.
#I believe I did particularly well in analyzing differing operating systems' strengths and weaknesses in regards to server side and client side operations.
#I found that analyzing requirements and design constraints prior to working on the actual application allowed for me to better understand what needed to be coded.
#If I could revise any part of this document, I would revise the domain model by going into more detail on how these various design patterns worked together to produce the intended function.
#I implemented a singleton class for GamingService to accommedate to the client's functionality needs. While this is a fictional company designed for coursework, it is important to follow user requirements because th client is hiring you to create a solution to their software problem and to meet expectations  you must consider all user needs and requirements in order to create a quality product.
#I approached software design by strictly following the client's requirements. For example, I implemented a singleton class because they requested one. The main technique I will use going forward is understanding requirements fully and planning how to implement those requirements in an effectiive way.

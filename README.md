<h2>Software-Design-Template</h2>
<h3>Overview:</h3>
<p>The Gaming Room was an online game developer wanting to create software to host their new game, Draw it or Lose It, across multiple operating systems, including mobile operating systems. The software was a database of user, team, and game object data along with a library of photos for gameplay.</p>
<h3>Stengths:</h3>
<p>I believe I did particularly well in analyzing differing operating systems' strengths and weaknesses regarding server-side and client-side operations. I found that analyzing requirements and design constraints before working on the actual application allowed me to better understand what needed to be coded.</p>
<h3>Improvements:</h3>
<p>If I could revise any part of this document, I would revise the domain model by going into more detail on how the design patterns work together to produce the intended function.</p>
<h3>Requirements:</h3>
<p>I implemented a singleton class for GamingService to accommodate the client's functionality needs. While this is a fictional company designed for coursework, it is important to always follow user requirements. The client is hiring you to create a solution to their software problem, therefore, to meet expectations you must consider all user needs and requirements to create a quality product.</p>
<h3>Approach:</h3>
<p>I approached software design by strictly following the client's requirements. For example, I implemented a singleton class because they requested one. The main technique I will use going forward is understanding requirements fully and planning how to implement those requirements effectively.</p>
